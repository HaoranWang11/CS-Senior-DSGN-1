## Project Sought
 - Looking for Software development projects, a practical one that could be actually used in companies would be prefered. Gaming industries have always been my preference because they are a lot of fun. Software Applications are also considered. I would like to fight with a team of 4-6 for a bigger project. A website is in my consideration as well if it counts for a senior design project.


# Project Abstract

LogLock, developed at the University of Cincinnati, is an innovative software solution designed to streamline the attendance process in educational settings. This web-based application allows instructors to easily record student attendance without the need for traditional roll calls or digital assignments. By running LogLock, instructors generate a secure web interface where students submit their names and student IDs. This data is then stored in an SQL database, ensuring accuracy and confidentiality.

The software utilizes Python for its development, offering robust database interaction and a user-friendly web interface. Its operational mechanism is straightforward: students enter their information on the website, and the system automatically logs the date and time, simplifying attendance verification for instructors. Educators can access the database to perform queries, generate reports, and analyze attendance data, thereby enhancing classroom management.

LogLock represents a technological advancement in educational administration, reducing administrative burdens and allowing educators to focus more on teaching and student engagement. Its integration of simple web technology with a reliable database system makes it an ideal solution for efficient and accurate attendance management in educational institutions.
