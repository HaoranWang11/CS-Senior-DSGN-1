Essay on Project Constraints

There are a number of restrictions that have come up while thinking about building our website for attendance verification that might potentially affect the outcome of our project.

Economic: Our technical preferences are greatly influenced by our finances. Due to a lack of resources, we now rely mostly on open-source tools and applications. The features and amount of sophistication we may achieve may be impacted by this dependency. Additionally, relying only on UC resources can result in constrained server resources or bandwidth, which could degrade user experience.

Ethical: Using numerous technology techniques including IP checking, facial recognition, and location tracking, our system tries to confirm students' attendance. This brings up a number of ethical issues. We may violate students' privacy by asking them to grant access to their location and face data. We must make sure that data acquisition is clear and that it is maintained securely to prevent unauthorized usage.

Legal: Facial recognition and location monitoring may subject us to legal repercussions, particularly in regions with severe data protection regulations. Students must provide their consent and should be given the option to decline. Additionally, utilizing open-source technologies could have ramifications for intellectual property that need to be carefully considered.

Data security is a duty that comes along with data collecting. Concerns include the possibility of data breaches, illegal access, and potential abuse. In order to safeguard student data and uphold confidence, it is essential to implement strong security mechanisms.

Social: By ensuring that students are showing up to class as scheduled, our project seeks to enhance the academic process. By doing this, it may improve the standard of instruction and the educational process as a whole. However, there is a chance that it might be viewed as intrusive or overzealous surveillance, which could have an impact on its societal acceptance.

Environmental: Our project appears to have a small influence on the environment at first glance. However, the energy used by the servers that host the website and databases. It's worthwhile to think about more efficient hosting configurations or code optimization.

Diversity and Cultural Impact: We must make sure that our solution is sensitive to cultural differences. Particularly with regard to racial and gender biases, facial recognition technology has come under fire. To prevent unintentional discrimination, we must make sure that our AI systems are trained on a variety of datasets. Furthermore, knowing cultural variations in privacy can help us make sure our approach is widely accepted.
