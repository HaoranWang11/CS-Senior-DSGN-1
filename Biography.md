## Project Sought
 - Looking for Software development projects, a practical one that could be actually used in companies would be prefered. Gaming industries have always been my preference because they are a lot of fun. Software Applications are also considered. I would like to fight with a team of 4-6 for a bigger project. A website is in my consideration as well if it counts for a senior design project.
